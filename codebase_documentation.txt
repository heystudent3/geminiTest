# Codebase Documentation for Pixel Quest Online

## Overview

Pixel Quest Online is a simple client-server application with a basic game loop. The server uses Express.js and WebSockets to handle client connections and communication. The client-side code renders a player on a canvas and establishes a WebSocket connection with the server.

## File Structure

*   `hosting_instructions.txt`: Provides instructions for hosting the client and server on Netlify and Render, respectively.
*   `client/index.html`: Sets up the basic HTML structure for the game, including a canvas element for rendering and links to the stylesheet and script.
*   `client/script.js`: Contains the client-side game logic, including WebSocket connection, rendering, and game loop.
*   `client/styles.css`: Provides basic styling for the game, including centering the canvas and setting a dark background.
*   `server/package.json`: Defines the server's dependencies, including Express.js and ws.
*   `server/server.js`: Sets up the WebSocket server using Express.js and handles client connections and communication.

## Server-Side Code (server/)

The server-side code is responsible for handling client connections and communication. It uses Express.js to serve static files and the `ws` library to handle WebSocket connections.

*   `server.js`: This file sets up the Express.js server and the WebSocket server. It listens for incoming WebSocket connections and handles messages from clients.
*   `package.json`: This file defines the server's dependencies, including `express` and `ws`.

## Client-Side Code (client/)

The client-side code is responsible for rendering the game and handling user input. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the game interface and logic.

*   `index.html`: This file sets up the basic HTML structure for the game, including a canvas element for rendering and links to the stylesheet and script.
*   `script.js`: This file contains the client-side game logic, including WebSocket connection, rendering, and game loop.
*   `styles.css`: This file provides basic styling for the game, including centering the canvas and setting a dark background.

## Hosting on Netlify (Client)

The client-side code is hosted on Netlify, a platform for hosting static websites.

*   **Build Process:** Netlify automatically detects the settings for static sites. No build command is needed.
*   **Deployment Settings:** The publish directory is set to `client`, as the `index.html` and other client files are located in the `client` folder.
*   **URL:** Netlify provides a unique URL (e.g., `your-site-name.netlify.app`) where the client is hosted.

## Hosting on Render (Server)

The server-side code is hosted on Render, a platform for hosting web services.

*   **Environment:** The environment is set to "Node".
*   **Build Command:** The build command is `cd server && npm install` to install the server's dependencies.
*   **Start Command:** The start command is `npm start` to start the server.
*   **URL:** Render provides a unique URL (e.g., `your-service-name.onrender.com`) where the server is hosted.

## Recommendations

The following recommendations can be implemented to improve the codebase:

*   **Security:** The server currently echoes back any message it receives from the client. This could be a security risk if the client sends malicious code. Consider sanitizing or validating the input before echoing it back.
*   **Scalability:** The server uses a single WebSocket connection for all clients. This could become a bottleneck as the number of clients increases. Consider using a more scalable architecture, such as a message queue or a distributed WebSocket server.
*   **Code Quality:** The client-side code could be improved by using a more modular structure and separating the game logic from the rendering logic.
*   **Error Handling:** The client-side code could be improved by adding more robust error handling for WebSocket connections.
